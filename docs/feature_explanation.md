# Detailed Feature Documentation for MyDollarBot

## Core Code Modules

### Budget Management
The budget management modules allow users to set, update, view, and delete budgets for personal finance management. These features help users maintain control over their financial goals by providing flexibility and transparency. This section includes several key modules:

- **`budget.py`**: This module is responsible for initializing and managing the budget for users. It provides functionality to define budget categories (such as food, entertainment, utilities), set initial values, and manage budget constraints based on user preferences.

- **`budget_update.py`**: Allows users to update their budget dynamically as needed. For example, if a user decides to increase their food budget after an unexpected event, they can use this module to make the changes seamlessly. This flexibility is essential for users with changing financial needs.

- **`budget_delete.py`**: Empowers users to delete specific budgets when they are no longer relevant or if a reset is required. For instance, if a user wants to reset the budget for a new fiscal year or month, this feature simplifies the process.

- **`budget_view.py`**: Offers users a clear view of the current budget allocations, aiding in decision-making and enabling users to quickly understand their financial position without navigating multiple screens or features.

### Expense Tracking
Tracking expenses is a core function of the MyDollarBot application, allowing users to manage and log various spending events. These modules make it easier to monitor expenses in real-time and categorize them effectively:

- **`add.py`**: Provides the ability to log expenses into predefined categories. For example, users can add grocery bills, utility payments, or entertainment expenses as they occur. This module is likely connected to the budget module, ensuring that each expense impacts the respective budget category.

- **`delete.py`**: Enables users to remove expenses if they were logged in error or if changes occur in the record. This functionality ensures accurate expense tracking by giving users control over their records.

- **`add_recurring.py`**: Adds functionality for recurring expenses such as rent or subscription services. Users can set recurring expenses to automatically log on a specified date, helping them automate routine financial tracking.

### Analysis and Reporting
This set of modules offers analytical tools to help users make informed decisions about their finances. They provide visualizations and estimates that give users insights into spending patterns and trends.

- **`graphing.py`**: Generates visual representations of budget allocations and expenses over time. For example, a user can see a line graph showing monthly expenses, helping them identify periods of high spending. Visualization is a powerful tool for users who prefer to see data graphically rather than in tabular form.

- **`estimate.py`**: Offers estimations based on previous expense patterns. Users can use this module to predict their next month's spending based on historical data. This feature is especially beneficial for users trying to plan for future expenses or understand average monthly costs.

### Utility Modules
Utility modules contain helper functions and supportive features that enhance the main modules' functionality. These modules provide essential services to ensure smooth operation and improve the user experience.

- **`helper.py`**: Acts as a repository for frequently used functions shared across modules. For instance, a function to format currency or a date might be included here. This module promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

- **`sendEmail.py`**: Sends email notifications based on specific events, such as when expenses exceed a defined threshold or when a recurring expense is due. Notifications keep users engaged and informed about their financial status.

## Documentation
The `/docs` folder includes detailed markdown files (such as `add.md`, `budget.md`, `delete.md`) describing each module’s purpose, usage, and implementation details. These files offer insight into the app's design for both users and developers, ensuring clear communication.

For instance, `add.md` could contain usage examples, expected inputs, and descriptions of each function within the add module, helping users understand how to correctly log their expenses.

---

## Testing
Automated testing ensures MyDollarBot’s reliability by verifying each feature functions as expected. Tests are written for each core feature in the `/test` directory, including modules such as `test_add.py` for testing the add expense functionality and `test_budget.py` for budget management. Each test case checks specific conditions, such as correct budget updates, deletion, or view responses, helping to maintain quality standards.

For example, the `test_add.py` script likely verifies that expenses are correctly added to budget categories and that appropriate errors are raised if incorrect data is provided.
