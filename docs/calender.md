# Calendar Feature

## Overview
The Calendar feature in TrackMyDollar allows users to select dates directly via an interactive calendar interface when adding or editing transactions. This makes it easy to keep track of past expenses and accurately log transactions for specific days.

## How to Use the Calendar Feature

   - When you want to add a new expense or income entry, type the `/add` or `/income` command.
   - The bot will prompt you to select a date using the calendar interface.

2. **Selecting a Date**:
   - Simply click on the desired date in the calendar. The selected date will be automatically added to the transaction entry.

3. **Editing Dates for Existing Entries**:
   - Use the `/edit <transaction_id>` command to modify an existing entry.
   - Choose a new date using the calendar, and the bot will update the transaction with the revised date.
