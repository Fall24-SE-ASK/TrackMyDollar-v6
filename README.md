## Installation and Quick Start guide

The below instructions can be followed in order to set-up this bot at your end in a span of few minutes! Let's get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.

2. In Telegram, search for "BotFather". Click on "Start", and enter the following command:
```
  /newbot
```
Follow the instructions on screen and choose a name for your bot. After this, select a username for your bot that ends with "bot".

3. BotFather will now confirm the creation of your bot and provide a TOKEN to access the HTTP API - copy and save this token for future use.

4. Copy the token provided by the bot and add/replace it in the user.properties file (in the format api_token=<your_token>).

5. Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) in your local system if you don't already have it installed

6. In the directory where this repo has been cloned, please run the below command to build a docker image, run it as container and see its logs:
```
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs bot -f
```

A successful run will generate a message on your terminal that says "TeleBot: Started polling." 

7. In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering the username and open the same. Now, on Telegram, enter the "/start" or "/menu" command, and you are all set to track your expenses!

Note: To stop the bot, run `docker compose down` in the repo directory.

## Usage
Hereâ€™s an overview of some key commands:

- Add Expense: /add <amount> <category> <description>
- View Daily Summary: /day
- View Monthly Summary: /month
- Edit/Delete Expense: /edit <id> or /delete <id>
- Set Recurring Expense: /recurring <amount> <category>
- Show Pie Chart: /chart
- Set Budget: /budget <amount>

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

Please note: A coverage below 70% will cause the build to fail.
